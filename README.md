# led-bar-menu
Getting lit (hah)

**highly recommend installing Code Spell Checker on VSCode, I've made a workspace dictionary that will hopefully help us avoid any yaml key errors when we edit the cocktail menu. Also it's just slick**

### Works! Notes:
- Publish the logs to the website
- shutdown pi button on website
- "did you mean" feature in lots of places (adding recipe/ingredient, searching, really anywhere there's user input)
- pi isn't automatically updating from github
- comments on recipes
- "add tag" option to modify spirits page

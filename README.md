# led-bar-menu
Getting lit (hah)

**highly recommend installing Code Spell Checker on VSCode, I've made a workspace dictionary that will hopefully help us avoid any yaml key errors when we edit the cocktail menu. Also it's just slick**

### Notes
- Unclear what to do when a recipe has options (i.e Anthracite prospector "congnac or similar brandy"). Could have this show up as a different color, but color seems like a good way to represent spirits
- Should display the recipe on the website (would need amounts), maybe that's enough to clear up confusion
- How to encode that in the yaml though

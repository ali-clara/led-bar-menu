Getting lit (hah)

### Notes
- Unclear what to do when a recipe has options (i.e Anthracite prospector "congnac or similar brandy"). Could have this show up as a different color, but color seems like a good way to represent spirits
- Should display the recipe on the website (would need amounts), maybe that's enough to clear up confusion
- How to encode that in the yaml though

### Units
- oz
- dash (bitters)
